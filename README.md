# Advanced-Product-Searching
A smart product search engine inspired by Google Search, built using **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and real-time **data visualizations**. This project demonstrates how different algorithms perform in real-world search scenarios.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Multiple Search Techniques:
  - **Linear Search** – Simple and effective for small datasets
  - **Indexed Search** – Fast lookups using pre-built mappings
  - **Fuzzy Search** – Handles typos and partial inputs
  - **Regex Search** – Pattern-based queries
  - **Binary Search** – Efficient numeric filtering (e.g., price)

- 📊 Data Visualization:
  - Bar charts comparing algorithm speed and results
  - Pie charts showing product availability
  - Visual comparison of brands, ratings, and prices

- 🧩 Core Functionalities:
  - Add, edit, delete, and view product details
  - Compare products by rating and price
  - Error handling for invalid/missing inputs
  - Real-time updates reflected in tables and charts

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Implement and evaluate multiple DSA-based search algorithms
- Analyze real-world search challenges (typos, incomplete inputs, numeric filters)
- Visualize performance metrics using Power BI and Matplotlib
- Apply OOP for modular and maintainable design
- Develop core product management operations (CRUD)
- Turn classroom concepts into real-world applications
